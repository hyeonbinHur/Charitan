## Hoang and Phat working on Admin Feature

Because there is no time to set debug with team A when merging, so that is all works in the assignment
Because there are no admin login feature, their are no third-party way to go admin feature, so we need to press directly http://localhost:5173/admin_role/

Frontend(React + Tailwind) port 5173
Team A backend(node.js) port 3000
Team B backend(spring poot) port 8080
